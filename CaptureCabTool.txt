Capture Cab Tool - To assist in testing batch classes.

This must either be used on a computer with Capture installed or with KfxCabAR.exe (from the bin folder) on the PATH environment variable or in the application folder.

Drag and drop a file to remove custom elements and reset the temporary image path if selected.  The resulting cab will be created in the same directory of the original cab as "<source>-test.cab".  Multiple files and files via command line are also acceptable.

XML files for each batch class will be created in C:\ACXMLAID\ and are ready to process.  Any existing XML in that folder will be copied to C:\ACXMLAID\XMLBackup.  Samples will be in C:\ACXMLAID\<cab name>.  The XML is structured so as to create a document for each form type present in the batch class using the existing sample pages.

Database Versions recognized, Release Scripts allowed, and Custom Modules allowed can be added via adding a file named CaptureCapTool.xml in the exe directory.  (The defaults are hardcoded.)  The format is as follows:
<CaptureCabTool>
	<DatabaseVersion CaptureVersion="7.5" DatabaseVersion="23" />
	<ReleaseScript Name="Ascent Capture Text" />
	<Module Name="scan.exe" />
</CaptureCabTool>

Tested with cabs from 6.1-8.0.  



Versions:
1.0.4 - Now handles custom modules in the following Batch Class settings: Auto-Foldering, Partial Batch Release, and Sort Options
1.0.5 - Fix issue with cabs with no sample images.
1.0.6 - Fix in 1.0.4 broke cabs from 6.1 because they did not have those settings.  Fixed.
